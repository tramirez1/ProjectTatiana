<h1>Bogota</h1>

<h2>Things to Do</h2>

<div>
<h4>Climb Monserrate</h4>
<p> Walk the steep steps up the hill (or take the funicular) to this incredible viewpoint of sprawling Bogotá.
    There’s a little white church at the top, but the act of climbing Cerro Monserrate and seeing the city from above is the real
     attraction here. It rises to 3,152 metres above the sea level, where there is a church with a shrine, devoted to El Señor Caído.
    </p>

<h4>The Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá</h4>
<p>
        One of the most popular day trips from Bogotá, the Salt Cathedral is located in the town of Zipaquirá about an hour outside the city.

This whole cathedral was carved deep underground in a salt mine, and it contains alcoves for worshipping and beautifully lit crosses.

It’s huge too, like a small town set 590 feet (180 meters) beneath the earth with places to eat and buy trinkets as well.
</p>

<h4>The Botero Museum</h4>
<p>
        Colombia’s (probably) most famous artist, Fernando Botero, was from Medellín and he painted portraits, famous people, animals, and fruits… all chubby.

        The artist is known for his paintings of overweight folks, and many of his works now hang in the Botero Museum in Bogotá.
        
        Located in a lovely, renovated colonial house with an internal courtyard, admission to this internationally important collection of art is free.
        
        The museum is also home to several pieces of art by other famous painters like Picasso, Monet, and Renoir.

<h4>Zona G</h4>
<p>
        Just a little south of Zona Rosa is another high-end neighborhood that’s filled with hip restaurants, cafes, bars, elegant hotels, and beautiful tree-lined streets.

Zona G (the “G” stands for “gourmet,” of course) has a range of different cuisines, and though it isn’t that cheap, it’s a fun place to spend an evening eating and bar-hopping.

You’ll have your pick of steak, Mexican, Peruvian, Lebanese, and Colombian, plus a few coffee shops and breweries.

Aside from drinks and fancy, romantic dinners, you can wander your way over to the Plaza de Lourdes for its impressive church and cheap eats like churros and fried arepas.

<h2>Restaurants</h2>

<div>
<h4>Andres Carne de Res</h4>

<p>It specializes in grilled meats and typical Colombian dishes: Order with sharing in mind so that you can sample the arepas de choclo
     (sweet corn cakes), papas criolla (Colombian potatoes), 
     chicharrones (fried pork rinds), lomo al trapo (cloth-wrapped grilled beef), and plátano maduro relleno de queso y bocadillo (baked plantains stuffed with cheese and guava). The rest is pure fun: live music, over-the-top decor, and improv actors who create a world of their own. If you want to party, Saturday is the best night (and the toughest reservation). 
    A very Colombian experience in one of Colombia’s most unique restaurants.
        </p>

<h4>Osaka</h4>

<p>With sister franchises in Chile, Peru, and Argentina, the Bogotá location of “Osk” owes its success to excellent food, great ambiance, and good service. The menu is based on Nikkei cuisine, a Peruvian-Japanese fusion, and features dishes like grilled shrimp with red curry-leek sauce and soy-marinated whole fish with crispy garlic, almonds, and Peruvian chiles.
    </p>

<h4>Harry Sasson</h4>
<p>With 30 years of experience, Harry Sasson is perhaps Colombia’s most famous chef. His eponymous restaurant, now in its third decade, is known for its service, consistency, ambiance, and the overall quality of its ingredients. Expect simple, well-prepared food that uses traditional cooking elements, like a wood-burning stove and a charcoal grill. Large cuts of meat are the specialty here; share some side dishes like the sauteed green beans with ginger and garlic or the cinnamon-perfumed rice with lentils. Try a few desserts with one of the many coffee offerings.
