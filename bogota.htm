                        sprawling Bogotá.
                        There’s a little white church at the top, but the act of climbing Cerro Monserrate and seeing
                        the city from above is the real
                        attraction here. It rises to 3,152 metres above the sea level, where there is a church with a
                        shrine, devoted to El Señor Caído.

                One of the most popular day trips from Bogotá, the Salt Cathedral is located in the town of Zipaquirá
                about an hour outside the city.

                This whole cathedral was carved deep underground in a salt mine, and it contains alcoves for worshipping
                and beautifully lit crosses.

                It’s huge too, like a small town set 590 feet (180 meters) beneath the earth with places to eat and buy
                trinkets as well.

                <td>
                Colombia’s (probably) most famous artist, Fernando Botero, was from Medellín and he painted portraits,
                famous people, animals, and fruits… all chubby.

                The artist is known for his paintings of overweight folks, and many of his works now hang in the Botero
                Museum in Bogotá.

                Located in a lovely, renovated colonial house with an internal courtyard, admission to this
                internationally important collection of art is free.

                The museum is also home to several pieces of art by other famous painters like Picasso, Monet, and
                Renoir.

                cafes, bars, elegant hotels, and beautiful tree-lined streets.

                Zona G (the “G” stands for “gourmet,” of course) has a range of different cuisines, and though it isn’t
                that cheap, it’s a fun place to spend an evening eating and bar-hopping.

                You’ll have your pick of steak, Mexican, Peruvian, Lebanese, and Colombian, plus a few coffee shops and
                breweries.

                Aside from drinks and fancy, romantic dinners, you can wander your way over to the Plaza de Lourdes for
                its impressive church and cheap eats like churros and fried arepas.

                de queso y bocadillo (baked plantains stuffed with cheese and guava). The rest is pure fun: live music,
                over-the-top decor, and improv actors who create a world of their own. If you want to party, Saturday is
                the best night (and the toughest reservation).

                excellent food, great ambiance, and good service. The menu is based on Nikkei cuisine, a
                Peruvian-Japanese fusion, and features dishes like grilled shrimp with red curry-leek sauce and
                soy-marinated whole fish with crispy garlic, almonds, and Peruvian chiles.

                like a wood-burning stove and a charcoal grill. Large cuts of meat are the specialty here; share some
                side dishes like the sauteed green beans with ginger and garlic or the cinnamon-perfumed rice with
                lentils. Try a few desserts with one of the many coffee offerings.
